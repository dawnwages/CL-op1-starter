      Calinda N. Lee founded Sources Cultural Resources Management, LLC with a philosophy of courageous curiosity—fearlessly exploring the past to develop cultural institutions and experiences committed to truth and innovation.  </p>
  <p class="pb-4">
    Sources provides historically-resonant inclusive interpretation in exhibitions, programs,  and media. Whether focused on institution-building or smaller curatorial projects, Lee’s work connects contemporary concerns to history in meaningful, personal, and often surprising ways. It is Calinda’s deep belief that information must be deployed creatively –and always intimately linked with community needs—to be of greatest service: “I try to make history personal every day, to connect lessons from the past to living in the present and planning for the future.”  </p>
